# papyrus-opcua-plugin
This project develops a Eclipse Papyrus Plugin which handles transforming UML Diagrams into OPC-UA information models.

## Prerequisites

### Papyrus UML Designer
The Plugin relies on an existing installation of Papyurs Eclipse Project https://www.eclipse.org/papyrus/. You can install it in Eclipse or download a optimized version from the project page https://www.eclipse.org/papyrus/download.html. The Plugin is developed using version 4.7.0.

### Install Designer Plugins
The Plugin depends on the availabillity of Papyrus Code Generators, therefore some Papyrus Designer Plugins need the be installed.
Add the following update Site to Papyrus: http://download.eclipse.org/modeling/mdt/papyrus/components/designer/
Then install the following items
- Papyrus base elements for code generation

### Installing the Plugin 
Download the .jar files from the latest release and drop them into the plugins folder of your Papyrus installation. 
Current Release https://github.com/model-UA/papyrus-opcua-plugin/releases/tag/v0.0.1-beta1 

## Using the Plugin

Currently the Plugin only supports transformation of Class Diagrams and no output of errors. Errornous entries will be ignored.
A Information Model can be generated by right clicking into a Diagram and selcting the Menu entry Designer->Generate OPC-UA Information Model 

### Error Logging
Not everything which is modelled in UML can be transformed into OPC-UA information models. Transformation Errors will be shown insided the Error Log of Papyrus which can be shown via Window->Show View->Error Log. Each log entry shows the qualified name of the UML and what the error is. 

## Debugging the Plugin
With the source code the plugin can debugged inside the Papyrus installation.

### Install Eclipse SDK
If you want to build or debug the plugin yourself you have to install the Eclispe SDK. This can be found in the Eclipse Project repository in the list of update sites.
Select the following items:
    - Eclipse SDK

### Loading the the Plugin
First the following folders have to imported as Eclipse Project into the Workspace. 
 - org.eclipse.papyrus.designer.languages.opcua.codegen
 - org.eclipse.papyrus.designer.languages.opcua.codegen.ui

Finally run or debug as Eclipse Application.
